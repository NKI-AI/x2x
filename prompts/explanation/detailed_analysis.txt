The MIL model assigns higher scores to patches exhibiting:
1. Poorly differentiated or highly proliferative tumor regions, often with epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition.
2. Invasion into or infiltration of surrounding adipose tissue.
3. Morphological features indicative of an aggressive tumor-stroma interface.
Conversely, lower scores are associated with better differentiation and organized immune infiltration.
